DFX is committed to creating a DEX aggregation platform that integrates market K-line, multi-chain aggregation DEX, and cross-chain exchange. Users can view TOKEN information, buy and sell Tokens, and exchange DEX with one click without jumping back and forth in various platforms. The trading pair adds liquidity and opens the era of one-stop DEX service for users!
What can DFX bring?
On-chain K-line: Provide decentralized K-line and various refined data services corresponding to tokens for all DEX trading pairs.
Aggregate transaction: One-click switching of the main chain wallet can realize the token transaction of each chain without jumping.
Cross-chain exchange: One-click cross-chain exchange transaction
Smart price selection: automatically find the best price to trade, and automatically split large orders into multiple orders to trade on different DEXs, reducing slippage and loss
Risk detection: one-click contract risk detection service
Authorization detection: After the transaction is completed, the contract authorization can be cancelled with one click to ensure asset security.
All kinds of data displayed by DFX directly interact with the chain, without any Sinochem server intervention, and can run in a completely unmaintained state. All data originates from the full-node server of the target chain, and is obtained synchronously in real time, especially the K-line. Real-time display is undoubtedly very helpful for investors to understand the overall situation of a token. Any user who trades with DFX can use these visual data to formulate trading strategies, capture the price difference and information of all tokens on DEX in real time, and lay a solid foundation for every successful investment.
DFX development concept:
DFX is fully managed by DAO, and the community is co-constructed and shared. The DFX development strategy or decision-making issues are all decided by community proposal voting. Community members who have brought excellent strategy proposals to DFX and adopted them and achieved success can all contribute according to their actual situation. Get rewarded with DT tokens.
DFX looks to the future:
DFX's first multi-functional application-based DEX platform enables new users to easily play DEX. This integrated service will surely become a DEFI interaction paradigm. In the future, DFX will also develop more data references and transaction forms based on the user's investment perspective, provide users with a one-stop service entry for DEX products facing global finance, and inspire to become the industry's best experience aggregation platform.
DFX development potential:
According to the analysis of interactive data on the DEX chain, the current daily transaction volume of DEX reaches tens of billions of dollars, and the daily handling fee is close to hundreds of millions of dollars, and this scale will become larger and larger in the future. DFX aggregates all mainstream chain data and DEX transactions, and its profit margin is beyond imagination. DFX is about to officially set sail. All people with lofty ideals are welcome to participate in community building and share the development dividends of DFX.
